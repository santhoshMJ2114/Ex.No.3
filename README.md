## Aim: 
To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting 3.Preceding Question Prompting and 4. Missing Word Prompting

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
##  Procedure:
1.	Straightforward Prompts:
    - •	"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
    - 	"List three advantages of electric vehicles."

 3.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     •	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."
     •	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    •	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
    •	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
4. Missing Word Prompting:
   •	"The capital of France is ____."
  •	"In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____."


## Output:

#### 1. Straightforward Prompting
Definition
A direct and clear instruction to the model without additional formatting or constraints.
Scenario Example
A customer wants to know the status of their order.
Prompt:
"Tell me the current status of order ID 56234."

Response:
"Order ID 56234 is in transit and will be delivered by tomorrow."

Advantage: Simple, quick, works well for direct queries.

#### 2. Tabular Format Prompting
Definition:
Prompting the model to provide output in a structured table format for better readability.
Scenario Example:
The customer asks about the comparison of three shipping options.
Prompt:
"Compare Standard, Express, and Same-Day shipping in a table with columns: Cost, Delivery Time, and Availability."

Response:
Shipping Option	Cost	Delivery Time	Availability
Standard	₹50	5–7 business days	Nationwide
Express	₹150	2–3 business days	Major cities
Same-Day	₹300	Within 24 hours	Selected locations

Advantage: Clear structure, useful for decision-making.

#### 3. Missing Word Prompting
Definition:
Providing a sentence or query with a missing word/phrase, prompting the AI to complete it.
Scenario Example:
The assistant needs to explain the return policy but the user only remembers part of it.
Prompt:
"The return policy allows customers to return products within ___ days of delivery."
Response:
"The return policy allows customers to return products within 30 days of delivery."

Advantage: Useful for knowledge recall, fill-in-the-blank learning, and testing AI accuracy.

#### 4. Preceding Question Prompting
Definition:
A question is asked before giving the main instruction to provide context and reasoning.
Scenario Example:
The assistant should explain why Express shipping is more expensive.
Prompt:
"Why is Express shipping faster? Explain this and then describe why it costs more."
Response:
"Express shipping is faster because it uses priority logistics, faster transport, and fewer distribution stops. It costs more because of higher fuel, manpower, and priority handling charges."

Advantage: Encourages deeper reasoning and multi-step answers.

##  Conclusion 

By applying different prompt engineering techniques:

Straightforward prompts → quick, direct answers.

Tabular format prompting → structured comparison.

Missing word prompting → fill gaps in information.

Preceding question prompting → richer reasoning and explanations.


##  Result:
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
